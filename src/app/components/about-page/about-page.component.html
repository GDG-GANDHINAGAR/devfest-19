            <p>So what is GDG exactly? Perhaps Google doesn't need an introduction.
                Google services became common nouns ‚Äî every day we "google" things we need to know,
                check our Gmail on the go, and Google Maps is a lifesaver.
                For regular users, they are just handy services, but not for us.
                Developers see much more: APIs, scalability issues, complex technology stacks.
                And that is what GDG is about. </p>

      <p>So what is GDG exactly? Perhaps Google doesn't need an introduction.
        Google services became common nouns — every day we "google" things we need to know,
        check our Gmail on the go, and Google Maps is a lifesaver.
        For regular users, they are just handy services, but not for us.
        Developers see much more: APIs, scalability issues, complex technology stacks.
        And that is what GDG is about. </p>

      <p>Also we are very talkative, so if you're a fellow community organizer
        or just have some random questions, feel free to reach any of us on social media.
        We'd love to help! </p>
